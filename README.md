       SUM(sales) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[sales_data_sample]
GROUP BY YEAR(orderdate)
ORDER BY Year;

````

**Answer:**


![year](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c6950b8-319c-48d8-afaa-878e6a0ec6c9)

- From 2003 to 2004, there was a steady increase in revenue, growing from approximately 3,516,980 in 2003 to around 4,724,163 in 2004. However, in 2005, revenue experienced a significant dip to roughly 1,791,487 due to incomplete data, as the records only include up to the fifth month of the year







**Step 2. Which month had the highest sales within a given year? What was the total revenue for that month?**

Objective: determine the peak sales period and quantify the revenue for that month. It helps identify when your business performed best within the year

````sql
SELECT MONTH_ID, SUM(sales) AS Revenue, COUNT(ORDERNUMBER) AS Frequency
FROM [dbo].[sales_data_sample]
WHERE YEAR_ID = 2004  -- Change the year to see the rest
GROUP BY MONTH_ID
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;

````

**Answer:**

**Step 11. Customer Segmentation**

Objective: Segmenting customers based on shared characteristics such as buying behavior, demographics, or preferences enables businesses to customize marketing efforts, enhance customer service, and develop products that better cater to each segment's needs. The segments were divided into six categories: Lost Customers, Slipping Away, Can't Lose, New Customers, Potential Churners, and Active and Loyal.


````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #rfm;

WITH rfm AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMERNAME,
           SUM(sales) AS MonetaryValue,
           AVG(sales) AS AvgMonetaryValue,
           COUNT(ORDERNUMBER) AS Frequency,
           MAX(ORDERDATE) AS last_order_date,
           (SELECT MAX(ORDERDATE) FROM [dbo].[sales_data_sample]) AS max_order_date,
           DATEDIFF(DD, MAX(ORDERDATE), (SELECT MAX(ORDERDATE) FROM [dbo].[sales_data_sample])) AS Recency
    FROM [PortfolioDB].[dbo].[sales_data_sample]
    GROUP BY CUSTOMERNAME
),
rfm_calc AS (
    SELECT r.*,
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY Recency DESC) AS rfm_recency,
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY Frequency) AS rfm_frequency,
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY MonetaryValue) AS rfm_monetary
    FROM rfm r

SELECT c.*, 
       rfm_recency + rfm_frequency + rfm_monetary AS rfm_cell,
       CAST(rfm_recency AS VARCHAR) + CAST(rfm_frequency AS VARCHAR) + CAST(rfm_monetary AS VARCHAR) AS rfm_cell_string
INTO #rfm
FROM rfm_calc c;

       rfm_recency, 
       rfm_frequency, 
       rfm_monetary,
       CASE 
           WHEN rfm_cell_string IN ('111', '112', '121', '122', '123', '132', '211', '212', '114', '141') THEN 'lost_customers'
           WHEN rfm_cell_string IN ('133', '134', '143', '244', '334', '343', '344', '144') THEN 'slipping away, cannot lose'
           WHEN rfm_cell_string IN ('311', '411', '331') THEN 'new customers'
           WHEN rfm_cell_string IN ('222', '223', '233', '322') THEN 'potential churners'
           WHEN rfm_cell_string IN ('323', '333', '321', '422', '332', '432') THEN 'active'
           WHEN rfm_cell_string IN ('433', '434', '443', '444') THEN 'loyal'
       END AS rfm_segment
FROM #rfm;

**Step 12. The Two Most Frequently Purchased Product Pairings**

Objective: It's about uncovering which products are often bought together. This information can help with cross-selling strategies, enhancing product recommendations, and improving store layouts.

````sql
SELECT
 DISTINCT OrderNumber, 
    STUFF((
        SELECT ',' + PRODUCTCODE
        FROM [dbo].[sales_data_sample] p
        WHERE ORDERNUMBER IN (
            SELECT ORDERNUMBER
            FROM (
                SELECT ORDERNUMBER, COUNT(*) rn
                FROM [PortfolioDB].[dbo].[sales_data_sample]
                WHERE STATUS = 'Shipped'
                GROUP BY ORDERNUMBER
            ) m
            WHERE rn = 2
        )
        AND p.ORDERNUMBER = s.ORDERNUMBER
        FOR XML PATH('')
    ), 1, 1, '') AS ProductCodes
FROM [dbo].[sales_data_sample] s
ORDER BY ProductCodes DESC;

````

**Answer:**

Action: Develop specific campaigns for each segment, like win-back strategies for Lost Customers or reward programs for Loyal Customers.

4. Focus on High-Performing Regions
Recommendation: Strengthen marketing efforts in regions with the highest revenue, such as EMEA.

Action: Allocate more resources to these regions and analyze what contributes to their success to replicate it in other areas.

5. Address Low-Performing Areas
Recommendation: Investigate why certain areas, like Japan, have lower sales.

Action: Conduct market research to understand barriers and adjust your strategies accordingly.

6. Analyze Sales Trends
Recommendation: Pay attention to the sales trends, such as the peak in November, to plan inventory and marketing campaigns.

Action: Prepare for increased demand in peak months and leverage this period for major promotional activities.

7. Monitor Deal Sizes
Recommendation: Encourage medium and large deal sizes by offering incentives or discounts for bulk purchases.

Action: Implement tiered pricing strategies to encourage customers to increase their order sizes.

8. Improve Order Status Management
Recommendation: Focus on maintaining a high shipped status while addressing issues that lead to cancellations and disputes.

Action: Enhance customer support and streamline the order fulfillment process to reduce cancelled and disputed orders.

These steps should help maximize revenue, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize marketing strategies.


## Limitations

- Incomplete Data: The dataset for 2005 is incomplete, potentially leading to skewed results and inaccurate comparisons with other years.

- Data Quality: The accuracy of the analysis relies heavily on the quality of the data. Missing values, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies can impact the findings.

- Segmentation Boundaries: The choice of segmentation criteria (e.g., RFM scoring) may not capture all nuances of customer behavior, potentially oversimplifying complex patterns.

- Assumptions in Pairings: The analysis of frequently purchased product pairings assumes that all recorded purchases are relevant, without considering seasonal or promotional factors.

- External Factors: The analysis doesn't account for external factors (e.g., economic changes, competitor actions) that may have influenced sales trends.

- Limited Time Frame: With the analysis mainly focused on a few years, long-term trends and patterns might be missed.

- Specific Variables: The focus on specific columns (e.g., sales, order dates) may overlook other important variables (e.g., customer feedback, product returns) that could provide deeper insights.
